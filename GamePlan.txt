    ///State of the Project and what to do next:
    - Numbers of Rows and Columns
    - Missing Special Moves (En Passant, Long/Short Castle, Promote) and Illegal Moves (King can still cross opponent's piece legal move, other pieces can still moves when king is checked), Checkmate and Draw
    - Need a funtion to show the available legal moves of a piece upon clicking
    - Missing an interface showing which pieces have been captured
    !!!Bug: - pawns can take the piece that is in front of them
            - piece can go through each other
            - currently not playable on mobile

    - add basic ai
    - make it a multiplayer game
    - add ai

    ///LEGAL MOVES
    - King cannot cross opponent's piece legal move   
    - IF A PIECE IS BLOCK, IT CAN NOT MOVE THROUGH THE BLOCKAGE
    
   ///PROPERTIES OF THE GAME
    May need sth to keep track of all the pieces available on the board (Maybe a matrix)
    - White move first
    - Number of material won/lost
    - Evaluation of the position (based on what?)
    - The king is checked when his current position aligns with the legal move of another piece
    - If king is checked, you the only legal moves are block the check or move the king
    - If king is checked, and he doesn't have any legal move, and no pieces can block the attack, game over
    - If there is no legal move available for either player, the game end in a draw
    - En Passant (Move count for rook/king)
        + The opponent's pawn must move two squares forward from its starting square
        + The opponent's pawn must land directly next to your pawn
        + Capture must be made on the next move
        + The capturing pawn moves diagonally forward one square to the square that the opponent's pawn just moved through. 
    - Long/Short Castling
        + The King and the Rook move count both == 0
        + There are no pieces between the king and the rook 
        + The king is not in check 
        + The king does not move through or end on a square attacked by an enemy piece:
